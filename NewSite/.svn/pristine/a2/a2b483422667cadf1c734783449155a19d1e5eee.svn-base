Then MVP is the way to go. In the concept popularized by Eric Ries, MVP or the  minimum viable product is a lean and agile development technique, where a new product, website or solution is developed with sufficient features to satisfy early adopters. We, at iHorse Technologies, understand and appreciate the relevance of this concept  and can offer development of your product on this technique. This keeps your resources of time and money invested into the product to the minimum requirement at each stage of its development. 

Its only after the MVP is approved by your users and you are convinced that your product is in the right direction do we finalize the product. This final and complete set of features is designed and developed only after considering feedback from the product&amp;#x27;s initial users.The advantages of the MVP Approach are :
Keeps your resources of time and money invested into the product to the minimum requirement at each stage of its development, thus providing greater flexibility. 
Phase to Phase Market feedback will be collected and considered
Helps understand your Target Market better
The Final product evolving would be an amalgamation of your idea, feedback from initial user’s and the best of technologies – a sure shot recipe to success!!</description>
